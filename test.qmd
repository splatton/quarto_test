## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
f <- function() g()
cat("Initiate f", file = stderr())
g <- function() h()
cat("Initiate g", file = stderr())
h <- function() i()
i <- function() stop("Error")
cat("Run f", file = stderr())
f()
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
